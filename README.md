# node-watch-directory
Watch a directory and execute a shell script when a file within that directory is changed.
Nothing special, just for personal use.

## Install
- `npm i chalk --save`
- `npm i chokidar --save`
- `npm i child_process --save`

Cause I can't be arsed to create a `package.json` file

## Usage
1. Create your shell script
2. Open `watch.js` and change the config options to suite your needs
3. Run `node watch.js`
